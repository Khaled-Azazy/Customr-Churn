# Customer Churn Analysis and Segmentation
## This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to gain insights and understanding of the factors contributing to customer attrition. The data is processed and analyzed using the Python libraries NumPy and Pandas. Additionally, a segmentation analysis is performed to identify common behavioral patterns among churned customers. Furthermore, a feature importance analysis is conducted to determine the most significant factors influencing customer churn.

## Usage

- Data Preprocessing: Ensure that the customer churn data is available in a suitable format. The data should be cleaned and preprocessed as necessary.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an exploratory analysis on the customer churn data using the provided code or custom scripts. This step involves loading the data, performing data cleaning, and generating visualizations to gain insights into the data.

- Segmentation Analysis: Conduct a segmentation analysis to identify common behavioral patterns among churned customers. Utilize clustering techniques or other segmentation methods to group customers based on their behavior.

- Feature Importance Analysis: Evaluate the importance of different features in predicting customer churn. Utilize machine learning algorithms or statistical techniques to determine the most significant factors contributing to customer churn.
